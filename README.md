# Password Generator

## Description 
I was tasked with creating a random password generator, in which the user decides the criteria of the password through prompts implemented through JavaScript. 

The user can choose the character length and whether they wish to incorporate lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters in their generated password. Once they have navigated through all the prompts, a password will be generated inside the box. 

This application is an effective method to protect sensitive data for optimal heightened security measures.

## User Story 
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data

I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria

SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

## Acceptance Criteria 
GIVEN I need a new, secure password

WHEN I click the button to generate a password

THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria

WHEN prompted for password criteria

THEN I select which criteria to include in the password

WHEN prompted for the length of the password

THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters

WHEN asked for character types to include in the password

THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters

WHEN I answer each prompt

THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected

WHEN all prompts are answered

THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria

WHEN the password is generated

THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

## Installation 
N/A

## Usage 
To use this application, users may click the "Generate Password" button displayed on the screen. They will then be prompted to enter the desired number of characters for their password. The number must be between 8-128 (if it is below or higher than the character limit, the user will be given an alert stating to enter a length within the stated parameters). 

The user will then be provided with prompts on whether or not they wish to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters in their password. After completing the prompts, the password generator will generate a password in the box.
