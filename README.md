## Description 
I was tasked with creating a random password generator, in which the user decides the criteria of the password through prompts implemented through JavaScript. 

The user can choose the character length and whether they wish to incorporate lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters in their generated password. Once they have navigated through all the prompts, a password will be generated inside the box. 

This application is an effective method to protect sensitive data for optimal heightened security measures.

## Installation 
N/A

## Usage 
To use this application, users may click the "Generate Password" button displayed on the screen. They will then be prompted to enter the desired number of characters for their password. The number must be between 8-128 (if it is below or higher than the character limit, the user will be given an alert stating to enter a length within the stated parameters). 

The user will then be provided with prompts on whether or not they wish to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters in their password. After completing the prompts, the password generator will generate a password in the box. 

## Screenshots 
The following images display the web application's updated appearance and functionality:

After selecting the prompts, a random password will be generated:
